Whack-a-Goph is a collection of small Go exercises designed to get you used to 
reading and writing Go code. Each exercise is a "gopher" popping up from a hole - 
fix the code to make the tests pass and "whack" the gopher!

Based on the fantastic Rustlings project but tailored for Go programmers.

Available commands:
  list    - Show all exercises and their status
  run     - Run a specific exercise  
  watch   - Watch mode for an exercise
  next    - Run the next pending exercise
  reset   - Reset progress for an exercise
  help    - Show help information

Get started with: %s`,
		cyan(gopher),
		yellow("Welcome to Whack-a-Goph!"),
		green("whack-a-goph list")),
	Run: func(cmd *cobra.Command, args []string) {

		fmt.Printf("%s\n\n", yellow("Welcome to Whack-a-Goph!"))
		fmt.Printf("Run %s to see all available exercises.\n", green("whack-a-goph list"))
		fmt.Printf("Run %s to start with the first exercise.\n", green("whack-a-goph next"))
		fmt.Printf("Run %s for more information.\n", green("whack-a-goph help"))
